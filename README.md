Advanced Computer Vision: Chapter 1 - Hand Tracking Basics
1. Introduction to Hand Tracking
Hand tracking is a crucial aspect of computer vision applications, enabling gesture recognition, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and human-computer interaction. By detecting and tracking hand movements, systems can interpret user gestures for various applications, including gaming, robotics, and sign language translation.

Advanced Computer Vision: Chapter 2 - Hand Tracking Module
1. Introduction to Hand Tracking Modules
A hand tracking module is a software or hardware-based solution that enables real-time detection, tracking, and analysis of hand movements. This module is essential for gesture-based applications, AR/VR interactions, and sign language recognition.

2. Components of a Hand Tracking Module
A typical hand tracking module consists of:

    Hand Detection Component:
        Identifies the presence of a hand in an image or video feed.
        Uses deep learning models (e.g., OpenCV, Mediapipe Hands, YOLO).

    Landmark Detection Component:
        Identifies key points (e.g., fingertips, knuckles, wrist).
        Example: Mediapipeâ€™s Hand Landmark Model detects 21 key points.

    Tracking and Smoothing Algorithm:
        Tracks hand movements across frames.
        Uses Kalman Filters, Optical Flow, or deep learning-based tracking.

    Gesture Recognition Module:
        Recognizes predefined gestures using Machine Learning (ML) models.
        Example: Sign language recognition using TensorFlow models.

Advanced Computer Vision: Chapter 2 - Pose Estimation
1. Introduction to Pose Estimation
Pose estimation is a fundamental problem in computer vision that involves detecting and tracking the position of key points (landmarks) of a human body, face, or hand in an image or video. The goal is to estimate the spatial configuration of an object (typically the human body) by identifying specific joints or key points.

Applications of Pose Estimation
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI): Gesture-based controls, sign language recognition.

Sports Analytics: Tracking player movements and performance analysis.

Healthcare & Rehabilitation: Posture correction, physiotherapy, and injury prevention.

Virtual Reality (VR) & Augmented Reality (AR): Real-time motion tracking.

Animation & Gaming: Motion capture for realistic character movements.

Surveillance & Security: Detecting abnormal postures for safety monitoring.
