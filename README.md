Advanced Computer Vision: Chapter 1 - Hand Tracking Basics
1. Introduction to Hand Tracking
Hand tracking is a crucial aspect of computer vision applications, enabling gesture recognition, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and human-computer interaction. By detecting and tracking hand movements, systems can interpret user gestures for various applications, including gaming, robotics, and sign language translation.

Advanced Computer Vision: Chapter 2 - Hand Tracking Module
1. Introduction to Hand Tracking Modules
A hand tracking module is a software or hardware-based solution that enables real-time detection, tracking, and analysis of hand movements. This module is essential for gesture-based applications, AR/VR interactions, and sign language recognition.

2. Components of a Hand Tracking Module
A typical hand tracking module consists of:

    Hand Detection Component:
        Identifies the presence of a hand in an image or video feed.
        Uses deep learning models (e.g., OpenCV, Mediapipe Hands, YOLO).

    Landmark Detection Component:
        Identifies key points (e.g., fingertips, knuckles, wrist).
        Example: Mediapipeâ€™s Hand Landmark Model detects 21 key points.

    Tracking and Smoothing Algorithm:
        Tracks hand movements across frames.
        Uses Kalman Filters, Optical Flow, or deep learning-based tracking.

    Gesture Recognition Module:
        Recognizes predefined gestures using Machine Learning (ML) models.
        Example: Sign language recognition using TensorFlow models.
